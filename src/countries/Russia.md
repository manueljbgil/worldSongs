excerpt: "Yana Stanislavovna 'Yanka' Dyagileva (Russian: Яна Станиславовна Дягилева) was a Russian poet and singer-songwriter and one of the most popular figures of her time in Russia's underground punk scene. Her songs explored themes of desperation and depression and punk-style nihilism. Her tragic death in 1991 has been considered as a symbolic end to the Siberian punk scene."
